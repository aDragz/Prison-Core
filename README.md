# Prison-Core

Prison Core is the ultimate core for your server.

## Why is it open sourced? Does this mean you are not working on it?
No, I made it open source because I do not believe in closed source Plugins or Applications. I will still work on this project. The reason there may not be many pushes is because I have added most features which I believe should be in a prison core. If you have any suggestions, you can talk to me in my discord

## Requirements
The only requirements you need to clone this project is Maven. It is a very known tool for compiling plugins.

## How to compile?
I use the command: `mvn clean install`
